# Camphr: spaCy plugin for Transformers, Udify, KNP

Hi, I'm [Yohei Tamura](https://github.com/tamuhey), a software engineer at PKSHA Technology. I recently published a spaCy plugin called [Camphr](https://github.com/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr/), which helps in seamless integration for a wide variety of NLP techniques from state-of-the-art to conventional ones. You can use [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) ,  [Udify](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/udify), [ELmo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), etc. on [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy).

This post introduce the features and simple usage of Camphr.

## Why I chose spaCy

spaCy is an awesome NLP framework and in my opinion has following advantages:

1. [Its superior architecture](https://spacy.io/api) makes it easy to integrate different methods. (everything from deep learning to pattern searching.)
2. You can save and reload pipelines with a single command.

The first feature is very important in practice. NLP has come a long way in the last few years, but real tasks are often not as simple as end-to-end models solve them. However, if we don't use the most advanced methods, there seems to be no future. With spaCy, you can combine a variety of methods from modern to rule-based. And Camphr makes it easy, for example, to fine-tune BERT and combine regular expressions.

The second feature makes it easy to store and restore complex combined pipelines and carry them around. You can iterate faster and the service gets better and better.

## Quick Tour

Let's take a quick look at what Camphr offers.

### Udify: BERT based Universal Dependency parser for 75 languages

[Udify](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/udify) is  Universal Dependency parser for 75 languages.

First, install udify as follows.
Because the model parameters are downloaded, it may take few minutes.

```console
$ pip install https://github.com/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr_models/releases/download/0.5/en_udify-0.5.tar.gz
```

That's all for the installation. Then use it as follows:

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("en_udify")
doc = nlp("Udify is a BERT based dependency parser")
spacy.displacy.render(doc)
```

Udify is a multilingual model, so you can parse German text *with the same model*: 

```python
doc = nlp("Deutsch kann so wie es ist analysiert werden")
spacy.displacy.render(doc) 
```

However, if you want to parse non-space-sparated languages (e.g. Chinese), you should replace tokenizer. Camphr provides helper function for this purpose:

```python
from camphr.pipelines import load_udify
nlp = load_udify("zh")
doc = nlp("也可以分析中文文本")
spacy.displacy.render(doc)
```

See the [documentation](https://camphr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/udify.html) for more details.

### Transformers embedding vector

[Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) provides state-of-the-art NLP architectures (BERT, GPT-2, ...). Camphr makes it easy to combine transformers and spaCy.
In this section, I will explain how to use Transformers models as text embedding layers. See next section for fine-tuning transformers models.

First, install camphr with pip:

```console
$ pip install camphr
```

And create `nlp` as follows:

```python
import camphr
# pass YAML or JSON or python Dict.
nlp = camphr.load(
    """
lang:
    name: en
pipeline:
    transformers_model:
        trf_name_or_path: xlnet-base-cased
"""
)
```

The configuration is parsed by [omegaconf](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf), so you can pass YAML or JSON or python Dict to `camphr.load`.
`trf_name_or_path` is a [transformers pretrained model name](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html) or a directory containing your transformers pretrained model.

Transformers computes the vector representation of an input text:

```python
>>> doc = nlp("BERT converts text to vector")
>>> doc.vector
array([[-0.5427, -0.9614, -0.4943,  ...,  2.2654,  0.5592,  0.4276],
    ...

>>> doc[0].vector # token vector
array([-5.42725086e-01, -9.61372316e-01, -4.94263291e-01,  4.83379781e-01,
    ... ]

>>> doc2 = nlp("Doc simlarity can be computed based on doc.tensor")
doc.similarity(doc2)
0.8234463930130005

>>> doc[0].similarity(doc2[0]) # tokens similarity
0.4105265140533447
```

Use nlp.pipe to process multiple texts at once:

```python
>>> texts = ["I am a cat.", "As yet I have no name.", "I have no idea where I was born."]
>>> docs = nlp.pipe(texts)
>>> Use nlp.to for faster processing (CUDA is required):
```
Use nlp.to for faster processing (CUDA is required):

```python
>>> import torch
>>> nlp.to(torch.device("cuda"))
>>> docs = nlp.pipe(texts)
```

See [the offcial documentation](https://camphr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/transformers.html) for more information.

### Fine-tuning transformers for downstream tasks

Camphr provides a CLI to fine-tune Transformers’ pretrained models for downstream tasks, e.g. text classification and named entity recognition. The CLI is built on top of [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra), which is awesome application framework.

You can fine-tune Transformers pretrained models for text classification tasks as follows:

```console
$ camphr train train.data.path="./train.jsonl" \    # training data
               model.textcat_label="./label.json" \ # label definition
               model.pretrained=bert-base-cased  \  # pretrained model name or path
               model.lang=en # spacy language
```

`train.jsonl` is a file containing training data in jsonl format:

```jsonl
["Each line contains json array", {"cats": {"POSITIVE": 0.1, "NEGATIVE": 0.9}}]
["Each array contains text and gold label", {"cats": {"POSITIVE": 1.0, "NEGATIVE": 0.0}}]
 ...
```

`label.json` contains all labels in json format:

```json
["POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE"]
```

All logs and model parameters are saved in "./outputs" directory, thanks to [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra)'s functionality.
You can use trained model as follows:

```python
>>> import spacy
>>> nlp = spacy.load("./output/2020-01-30/19-31-23/models/0")
>>> doc = nlp("Hi, this is fine-tuned model")
>>> doc.cats
{"POSITIVE": 0.812342, "NEGATIVE": 0.187658}
```

To create python package, use [spacy package](https://spacy.io/api/cli#package) CLI:

```console
$ mkdir packages
$ spacy package ./output/2020-01-30/19-31-23/models/0 ./packages
```

You can configure training or fine-tune for other tasks. See [the documentation](https://camphr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/finetune_transformers.html) for details.

### Elmo: deep contextualized word representation

[Elmo](https://allennlp.org/elmo) is a deep contextualized word representation published by [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/).
Camphr enables you to use Elmo with spaCy.

First, install the model as follows:
Because the model parameters are downloaded, it may take few minutes.

```console
$ pip install https://github.com/PKSHATechnology-Research/camphr_models/releases/download/0.5/en_elmo_medium-0.5.tar.gz
```

That's all for the installation. Then use it as follows:

```python
>>> import spacy
>>> nlp = spacy.load("en_elmo_medium")
>>> doc = nlp("One can deposit money at the bank")
>>> doc.tensor
array([[-1.8180828e+00,  4.4738990e-01, -1.3872834e-01, ...,
>>> doc[0].vector # token vector
array([-1.8180828 ,  0.4473899 , -0.13872834, ...
```

Because Elmo is a contextualized vector, each token has a different vector even if they are the same words.

```
>>> bank0 = nlp("One can deposit money at the bank")[-1]
>>> bank1 = nlp("The river bank was not clean")[2]
>>> bank2 = nlp("I withdrew cash from the bank")[-1]
>>> print(bank0, bank1, bank2)
bank bank bank
>>> print(bank0.similarity(bank1), bank0.similarity(bank2))
0.8428435921669006 0.9716585278511047
```

If you want to use other Elmo models (e.g. non-English models), please refer to the [official documentation](https://camphr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/elmo.html)

### Conclusion

In this article, I introduced how to use Transformers, Udify, Elmo with spaCy. spaCy makes it easy to combine different approches with unified interface.

Camphr is still in its infancy. We will continue to make it possible to handle various NLP methods on spaCy.
