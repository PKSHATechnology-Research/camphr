Fine-tuned models are stored in "./output/DATE/TIME/models/${i}" directories.
:code:`${i}` is the number of the training steps (e.g. :code:`0` for the first training loop).
The model can be loaded as follows:

    >>> import spacy
    >>> nlp = spacy("./output/2020-01-30/19-31-23/models/0")

.. seealso::

    `spacy.package <https://spacy.io/api/cli#package>`_ : Create *python model package* to distribute the models.
