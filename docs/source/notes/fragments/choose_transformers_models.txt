The following models can be used:

1. **Transformers official models**

Pretrained models listed in `Transformers website <https://huggingface.co/models>`_ can be used **without manually downloading **. The model will be automatically downloaded and cached at the start of the training.

2. **Transformers models in local directory**

You can also use local models created by :code:`transformers.PretrainedModel.save_pretrained` method, by passing :code:`pretrained=/path/to/your-modles` in cli.
